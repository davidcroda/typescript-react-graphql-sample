## TypeGraphQL / React Sample Project

This is a personal sample project I am working on to demonstrate my ability with TypeScript, GraphQL, and ReactJS. I took a static resume template site, converted it to a React single page app, and built a GraphQL API to power the data. The GraphQL API uses TypeORM, TypeGraphQL, and is backed by a Postgres database. This is a work in progress.

#### Running the GraphQL API
 - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
 - `cd web`
 - `docker-compose up`

#### Running the ReactJS Front End
 - `cd web`
 - `yarn install`
 - `yarn start`
